class Population(object):
    '''
    An abstract container class for a collection of individuals to be used in 
    a 'particle filter' type of search.
    
    At each generation, the probability that the ith individual W[i,:] will be 
    selected for the next generation is proportional to 
    exp(-C[i]/T) where C[i] is the cost of W[i,:] and T is a temperature parameter.
    See 'resample' method.
    
    Usage:
       - Initialize a population 'pop' with the constructor of a subclass 
           derived from Population.       
       - Call pop.particle_filter_search()
       - Retrieve pop.best_w
